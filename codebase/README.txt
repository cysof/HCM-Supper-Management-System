HCM Supermarket Management System
Introduction
Welcome! This project implements a comprehensive digital supermarket management system using cutting-edge technologies. It empowers supermarkets with streamlined operations, enhanced inventory control, and improved customer experiences.
Key Features:
Product Management: Add, edit, and delete products, manage stock levels, and track prices effectively.
Sales Management: Process customer purchases accurately, generate receipts, and stay on top of sales trends.
Inventory Control: Maintain optimal stock levels, avoid stockouts, and reduce wastage through efficient inventory management.
Customer Management: Create customer profiles, track purchase history, and provide personalized promotions. (Optional, based on your project scope)
Reporting: Generate insightful reports on sales, inventory, and customer behavior to make data-driven decisions. (Optional)
Technologies:
 Backend: Django REST Framework (Python)
 Frontend: React.js (JavaScript)
Project Deployment:
The deployed application is currently unavailable due to privacy and security considerations for real-world supermarket data. However, you can explore the functionalities and code structure locally by following the installation instructions below.
Installation
1.Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3 and Node.js with npm installed on your system. You can download them from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and https://nodejs.org/en https://nodejs.org/en respectively.
2. Clone the Repository:
https://github.com/cysof/HCM-Suppermarket-Management-System.git
3. Navigate to the Project Directory:bash
   cd HCM-Supermarket-Management-System
  4. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows/Linux
   source venv/Scripts/activate.bat  # Windows Only
   5. Install Backend Dependencies:bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   6. Install Frontend Dependencies:bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   7. Create Backend Secret Key: (Create a new file named `secret_y.py` at the project root with the following line, replacing your_secret_key, with a strong random string)
   python
   SECRET_KEY = your_secret_key'
  8. Set Environment Variables:  (Optional, if applicable) Create a `.env` file at the project root to store sensitive environment variables for the backend. Refer to the Django documentation for details on environment variable configuration.
9. Migrate Backend Database: (Assuming you're using a databasebash)
   python manage.py migrate
   10. Run Backend Server: bash
   python manage.py runs server
    This will typically start the server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. The exact port may vary.
11. Start Frontend Development Server: (Optional, for hot reloading) bash
   cd frontend   npm stard
   This will usually start the development server on `http://localhost:3000/`. The exact port may vary.
Additional Notes:

 Configuration details might differ slightly depending on your specific environment and project setup. Refer to the Django and React documentation for further guidance on setting up and customizing these frameworks.
Usage
Once the application is running, you can access the frontend interface. The specific usage instructions will depend on the functionalities you've implemented. Consider creating additional documentation within the project to guide users on operating the system.
